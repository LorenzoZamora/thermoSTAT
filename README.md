# thermoSTAT
---
<p> This is the mobile phone application for my [ECE 4800 - Senior Design] project.
<br><br>The project aims to integrate one's smartphone with an external temperature sensor, to make 
<br>COVID-19 symptom testing all in one, with qualitative questions and quantitative temperature taking.
<br><br>Being built in React Native allows this phone application to be used by both Apple and Android users alike!
<br>Feel free to try it out in Expo. üòÅ</p>
